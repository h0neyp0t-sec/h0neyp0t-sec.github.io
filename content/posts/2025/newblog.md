Hello everyone ! 

Guess who is starting a new blog ? Yes it's me, **h0neyp0t**. ðŸ˜Ž 

At first I wanted to do it on Hashnode like I used to but Hashnode is not the same anymore.

# Bye Hashnode
## What is Hashnode ? 
Hashnode is a blogging platform with a focus on developers. This site brought some interesting features like the possibility to connect a domain (for free). Its popularity peaked around 2022 and was a good opportunity to create a free blog, with CSS customisation and Markdown support.

## Why I Left
I used to love Hashnode, for real. It was the best alternative to Medium and Wordpress, in my opinion and this was true... 3 years ago. Now it is another piece a bread. 

There are a few reasons why I am saying that : 
1. Hashnode is full of spam accounts 
2. A lot of people left 
3. No featured posts since 2024
4. No updates to change log since 2024
5. No more custom CSS
6. Nobody on the r/hashnode subreddit 
7. No support 
8. The discord invite link is broken (I can't even complain)

And this is really sad, I really hope they will do something for all of that. Anyways, I wanted to write again but I couldn't find a good alternative that meet all my requirements unless I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

# What Is Hugo ? 
According to the website : 

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

And they didn't lie, Hugo is really fast and fun. Hugo is amazing for static sites like a portfolio or a simple blog.

# Why A New Blog ? 
I love content creation on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/h0neyp0t.sec) but it has some limits. I can't talk about everything I want for several reasons : 
- Instagram is for short form of content
- My content can be flag as harmful if it's too technical (this happened to a lot of people)
- Too much reliance on the algorithm
In a nutshell, a blog gives me more freedom. 

I don't know if I will post my old posts here but I hope you will like this new blog, let me know if you do. And remember... Never stop learning.
