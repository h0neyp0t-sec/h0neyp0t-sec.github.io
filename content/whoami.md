Hello everyone ! This is **h0neyp0t**, and welcome to my blog.

My passion lies in various topics including cybersecurity and system administration. As an **ethical hacker**, I specialize in both offensive and defensive security, making it my mission to share knowledge and insights in this critical field. This passion for teaching has led me to embrace **content creation**, which you can see in action on my Instagram account (**h0neyp0t.sec**) and this website.

Originally from France, I have always been fascinated by technology and its impact on our lives. My curiosity about how technology works and the challenges it presents motivates me to continuously learn and grow in this field.

Through this blog, I aim to share insights, tips, and technical knowledge that can help others navigate the complexities of cybersecurity. Feel free to reach out on social media (in French or in English). 


And remember... *Never stop learning*. ðŸ’»
